It was lovely summer weather, and the sun shone brightly upon the country. The swallows flew over the fields, and the storks stood on one leg, talking to one another and looking very stately, when all at once a great, ugly duckling came out of the egg.

It was a large, greyish-brown thing, and it felt as though it was born into the world to be laughed at and scoffed at by all the other ducks.

This duckling was not pretty to look at; it was very large and had a dull, dirty grey color, and it had no grace or beauty. But as soon as it began to walk, it made the most awkward and clumsy attempts to keep up with the others, and even the smallest of the ducklings laughed at it.
