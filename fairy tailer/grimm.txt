Once upon a time, there was a poor woodcutter who had two children, a little boy called Hansel and a girl called Gretel. They were very poor and had nothing to eat, so the woodcutter's wife thought of a plan to get rid of them.

One evening, as they were walking in the forest, she took Hansel and Gretel to the deepest part and told them to wait there. When they were left alone, Hansel and Gretel were very frightened. But Hansel, who had a small piece of bread, managed to find their way back home.

The next day, the woodcutter's wife took them even deeper into the forest, and this time they were lost for good. They wandered around and finally found a house made of candy. As they were eating the candy, a wicked old witch who lived there captured them, planning to eat them.
